# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

1- Transfer the web application server to the private subnet.
2- Add a NAT Gateway or a Web proxy to control the egress traffic.
3- Add AWS WAF in order to block the attacks to the CloudFront.
4- Disallow the ssh access to the instance and use System Manager instead.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

This act will only prevent the internet traffic to the S3 not securing the S3 bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. Existing objects will not be affected with the new encryption setting only the new objects get affected.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All made changes will be overriden by the cloudformation file.
